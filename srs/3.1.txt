User's have two methods of loggin into the system as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4. Figure 1 shows the kiosk system login. This interface is designed for use by students and tutors for arrivals and depatures only. It does not log the user into the web portal.
Figure 3 demonstrates the standard user login to access the portal. All users of the system have the ability to login with this interface to access further functionality such as Question and Answer system as well as administrative duties such as reports and management. Both the Kiosk (Figure 2) and user login (Figure 3) trigger a new user registration if the system has no previous record of a user logging in and the user has valid WVU Credentials. 
Figure 4 Shows the format of the portal once a user has successfully logged in. The portal contains navigation links to all roles/functions a user has permission to access.
